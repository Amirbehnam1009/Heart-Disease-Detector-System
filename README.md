## Step One: Fuzzification

Fuzzification is a pivotal step in the process, involving the conversion of precise, absolute values into fuzzy, imprecise ones. This transformation is essential for accommodating uncertainties inherent in real-world data. Through fuzzification, we establish fuzzy sets and determine the degree of membership for each value within these sets. The process is guided by membership functions, which visually depict the degree of belongingness.

## Step Two: Inference

Following fuzzification, the next step involves evaluating the fuzzy values obtained against predefined rules. This inference step is crucial for problem-solving within the framework of fuzzy logic.

## Step Three: Defuzzification

The final stage, defuzzification, marks the transition from the realm of fuzzy values back to absolute ones, culminating in a clear answer. This process involves various methods, with the center of mass method being one of the most prominent and widely employed. Through iterative deductions, we refine our fuzzy outputs into precise, actionable solutions.
